# 06. Control Implementations – PE: Physical & Environmental Protection  
APJ SecureCloud – FedRAMP Low (LI-SaaS)

APJ SecureCloud is a SaaS platform hosted entirely in Microsoft Azure Government
(IL2), a FedRAMP-authorized infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) environment.
APJ does not operate, manage, or access any physical servers, networking
equipment, storage arrays, datacenter facilities, or environmental systems.

**All Physical & Environmental Protection (PE) controls are inherited from:**

- Microsoft Azure Government  
- Azure Gov FedRAMP Provisional Authorization (P-ATO)  
- Azure Gov IL2 security capabilities  
- Azure SOC 2, FedRAMP, ISO 27001, and CJIS attestations  

APJ maintains a fully cloud-hosted architecture and has no physical footprint.

# **PE-1 – Physical & Environmental Protection Policy and Procedures (Inherited)**

Azure Government implements and documents PE policies covering:

- Physical access control  
- Visitor management  
- Datacenter access provisioning  
- Power redundancy  
- Cooling and fire suppression  
- Environmental monitoring  

APJ SecureCloud inherits all PE-1 protections from Azure Gov and references
Microsoft's FedRAMP Security Package for control evidence.

---

# **PE-2 – Physical Access Authorizations (Inherited)**

Azure Gov enforces strict physical access controls:

- Background checks  
- Access provisioning  
- Multi-factor authentication  
- Role-based access  
- Visitor escort requirements  

APJ personnel **do not require or maintain** datacenter physical access.

---

# **PE-3 – Physical Access Control (Inherited)**

Azure Gov datacenters implement:

- Biometric access controls  
- Smart cards  
- Security officers  
- Mantraps  
- Anti-tailgating systems

APJ has no capability to access these facilities and inherits controls fully.

---

# **PE-4 – Access Control for Transmission Medium (Inherited)**

Azure Gov protects all network transmission media:

- Fiber cabling inside secured conduits  
- Protected cabling rooms  
- Tamper-evident seals  
- Strict physical controls  

APJ relies exclusively on Azure Gov managed network paths.

---

# **PE-5 – Access Control for Output Devices (NOT APPLICABLE – Documented)**

APJ does not operate:

- Printers  
- Copiers  
- Fax machines  
- Local output devices  

All output is viewed digitally through secure consoles.

Thus, PE-5 is **Not Applicable** for APJ SecureCloud.

---

# **PE-6 – Monitoring Physical Access (Inherited)**

Azure Gov uses comprehensive monitoring:

- Video surveillance  
- Security guards  
- Intrusion detection  
- 24/7 SOC operations  
- Access log retention  

APJ inherits all activities.

---

# **PE-8 – Visitor Records (Inherited)**

Azure Gov maintains:

- Visitor rosters  
- Escort logs  
- Facility entry/exit records  
- Badge logs  

APJ has **no visitors** to any facility.

---

# **PE-9 – Power Equipment & Cabling (Inherited)**

Azure Gov datacenters maintain:

- Protected cabling  
- Backup power  
- UPS systems  
- Surge protection  

APJ has no physical assets requiring local power protection.

---

# **PE-10 – Emergency Shutoff (Inherited)**

Azure Gov manages:

- Emergency power shutoff  
- Fire suppression isolation  
- Environmental system kill switches  

APJ does not interact with these systems.

---

# **PE-11 – Emergency Power (Inherited)**

Azure Gov facilities include:

- Redundant UPS  
- Diesel generators  
- Automatic transfer systems  

Ensuring continuous service availability.

---

# **PE-12 – Emergency Lighting (Inherited)**

Azure Gov datacenters maintain:

- Illuminated exit routes  
- Backup emergency lighting  
- Emergency power safety systems  

APJ inherits this control.

---

# **PE-13 – Fire Protection (Inherited)**

Azure Gov implements:

- Fire suppression  
- Automatic detection systems  
- Temperature/smoke sensors  
- Datacenter fire response procedures  

APJ relies entirely on these protections.

---

# **PE-14 – Temperature & Humidity Controls (Inherited)**

Azure Gov environmental controls include:

- HVAC cooling redundancy  
- Humidity monitoring  
- Fail-over environmental systems  

APJ inherits all environmental control measures.

---

# **PE-15 – Water Damage Protection (Inherited)**

Azure Gov provides:

- Raised flooring  
- Water leak sensors  
- Physical isolation from plumbing systems  

APJ inherits all water damage prevention systems.

---

# **PE-16 – Delivery & Removal (Inherited)**

Azure Gov manages:

- Hardware delivery  
- Component replacement  
- Hardware sanitization  
- Asset disposal  

APJ does not interact with hardware deliveries or removals.

---

# **PE-17 – Alternate Work Site (Inherited)**

Azure Gov ensures continued operations through:

- Geo-redundancy  
- Region-level failover  
- Distributed physical hosting  

APJ has no physical alternate sites.

---

# **PE-18 – Location of Information System Components (Inherited)**

Azure Gov ensures that all components are hosted:

- In U.S.-based, FedRAMP-authorized datacenters  
- With strict location-based access controls
